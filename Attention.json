{"lyrics": "Attention Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHey!\nNow that you have my attention\nWhat are you gonna do\nYou might have good intentions\nBut they're not coming through\n\nYou're very pleased with yourself I see\nIt's like a walk in the park\nYou aren't enlightened by anybody else, 'cause\nYou can see in the dark\n[Chorus]\nGot a lock, got a key\nGot some kind of vice-like grip on me\nOn a leash, by the reigns\nGot a look that puts me in chains\n\n[Verse 2]\nI tried a subtle suggestion\nA more direct approach\nI can't make a connection\nYou're beyond reproach\n\nNo need for petty excuses\nNo need for thumbing around\nI don't know what the use is\nOr what you're throwing down\n\n[Chorus]\nGot a lock, got a key\nGot some kind of vice-like grip on me\nOn a leash, by the reigns\nGot a look that puts me in chains\n\n[Bridge]\nDo you love the reflection\nDo you love the reflection\nDo you like what you see\nDo you like the attention\nDo you like the attention you get from me\nHey yeah, hey hey\nYou might also likeNow that you have my attention\nGot some kind of vice-like grip on me\n\n[Outro]\nGot a lock\nGot a key1Embed"}
