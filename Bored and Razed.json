 {"lyrics": "Bored and Razed Lyrics[Verse 1]\nRolling a juke joint box in the corner\nTrolling myself in the mirror at night\nKeeping an eye on my grindstone future\nStaying away from the left and the right\n\n[Chorus 1]\nCalifornia bored and razed\nThese days, she's living with another\nPlastic features, perfect face\nWhat a waste and I'm still thinking of her\n[Verse 2]\nLaying the cardinal sins on the table\nPouring the coffee out on the grounds\nChanging the losses to wins if I'm able\nSwitching the pitch to an audible sound\nRunning the rounds of the mundane soldier\nTrading the cards and erasing the names\nFeeling a pounding, insane, colder\nSounding, system, feeding the flames\n\n[Chorus 2]\nWell, I'm Detroit born and raised\nBut these days, I'm living with another\nYou tell me she can be replaced\nBut that's not the case, I'm so lost without her\n\n[Verse 3]\nRolling a juke joint box in the corner\nTrolling myself in the mirror at night\nKeeping an eye on my grindstone future\nStaying away from the left and the right"}
