Use this function to print the polarity scores (with the name of the song) of the three files you created in question 3.  Does the reported polarity match your understanding of the song's lyrics? Why or why not do you think that might be?  Answer the questions in either a comment in the code cell or a markdown cell under the code cell."

    "I would like to note I had to go in a manually edit the json files I created, as when they are first created they contain a ton of information not relevant to the lyrics of the songs. I would say that the polarity of most of these songs matches my understanding of the lyrics. Attention is a more upbeat song where as bang bang is a slower darker song (bang bang is especially dark).I would say that the polarity calculated is quite accurate. Bored and Razed surpised me a bit, it is upbeat but looking back on the lyrics now it makes sense the polarity is low. The word bored is used a lot so that probably adds to the low polarity. Blue veins also suprised me, the song actually sounds super sad but reading the lyrics is actually about loving someone (I had to go back and look after seeing the polarity score)."
