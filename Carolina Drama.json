{"Carolina Drama Lyrics[Intro]\nI'm not sure if there's a point to this story\nBut I'm going to tell it again\nSo many other people try to tell the tale\nNot one of them knows the end\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt was a junk house in South Carolina\nHeld a boy the age of ten\nAlong with his older brother Billy\nAnd their mother and her boyfriend\nWho was a triple loser with some blue tattoos\nThat were given to him when he was young\nAnd a drunk temper that was easy to lose\nBut thank God he didn't own a gun\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, Billy woke up in the back of his truck\nTook a minute to open his eyes\nHe took a peep into the back of the house\nAnd found himself a big surprise\nHe didn't see his brother, but there was his mother\nWith her red-headed head in her hands\nWhile the boyfriend had his gloves wrapped around an old priest\nTrying to choke the man\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nBilly looked up from the window to the truck\nThrew up, and had to struggle to stand\nHe saw that red-necked bastard with a hammer\nTurn the priest into a shell of a man\nThe priest was putting up the fight of his life\nBut he was old and he was bound to lose\nThe boyfriend hit as hard as he could\nAnd knocked the priest right down to his shoes\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell, now Billy knew but never actually met\nThe preacher lying there in the room\nHe heard himself say, \"That must be my daddy\"\nThen he knew what he was gonna do\nBilly got up enough courage, took it up\nAnd grabbed the first blunt thing he could find\nIt was a cold, glass bottle of milk\nThat got delivered every morning at nine\n\n[Verse 5]\nBilly broke in and saw the blood on the floor\nAnd he turned around and put the lock on the door\nHe looked dead into the boyfriend's eye\nHis mother was a ghost, too upset to cry\nThen he took a step toward the man on the ground\nFrom his mouth trickled out a little audible sound\nHe heard the boyfriend shout, \"Get out!\"\nAnd Billy said, \"Not 'til I know what this is all about\"\n\"Well, this preacher here was attacking your mama\"\nBut Billy knew just who was starting the drama\nSo Billy took dead aim at his face\nAnd smashed the bottle on the man who left his dad in disgrace\nAnd the white milk dripped down with the blood\nAnd the boyfriend fell down dead for good\nRight next to the preacher who was gasping for air\nAnd Billy shouted, \"Daddy, why'd you have to come back here?\"\nHis mama reached behind the sugar and honey\nAnd pulled out an envelope filled with money\n\"Your daddy gave us this,\" she collapsed in tears\n\"He's been paying all the bills for years\"\n\"Mama, let's put this body underneath the trees\nAnd put daddy in the truck and head to Tennessee\"\nJust then his little brother came in\nHolding the milk man's hat and a bottle of gin\n[Bridge]\nSinging": null, " la la la la, la la la la, yeah\nLa la la la, la la la la, yeah\nLa la la la, la la la la, yeah\nLa la la, la la la...\nLa la la la, la la la la, yeah\nLa la la la, la la la la, yeah\nLa la la la, la la la la, yeah\nLa la la, la la la...\n\n[Outro]\nWell now you heard another side to the story\nBut you wanna know how it ends?\nIf you must know the truth about the tale\nGo and ask the milkman5Embed": null}
