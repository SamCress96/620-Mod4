   "lyrics": "Blue Veins Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWhen I was surrounded by the world\nYou were the only one who came\nAnd you were the only one astounded\nWhich kept me grounded\nAs the other girls trashed my very name\n\n[Chorus 1]\nThen I looked over just in time to see her smiling back at me\nAnd saying everything's okay\nAs long as you're inside my blue veins, your blue veins\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, and the feeling that you gave me\nNo matter what I do or where I go it always will remain\nAnd those who would enslave me\nTo get to me must get past you and will have no luck\n'Cause you'll protect me from all pain\nIt's true, you know but\n\n[Chorus 2]\nThe most beautiful, yeah, the most beautiful thing\n'Cause anything else can't compare\nMust be the blood that's running through your blue veins\n\n[Break]\nYour blue veins\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd I know you won't deceive me\nLike the rest and there's nothing you need to explain\nYou're always the first one to believe me\nWhen I said to you girl, I think it's gonna rain\nBut I could be wrong\n\n[Chorus 3 - Outro]\nYeah but all of these things, all these things\nThey're all truly nice but ain't nothing\nAin't nothing compared to the love\nThat's running through your little blue veins, your blue veinsYou might also like6Embed"
