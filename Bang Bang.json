{"lyrics": "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down) LyricsI was five and he was six\nWe rode on horses made of sticks\nHe was black and I was white\nHe would always win the fight\n\nBang bang, he shot me down\nBang bang, I hit the ground\nBang bang, that awful sound\nBang bang, my baby shot me down\n\nSeasons came and changed the time\nWhen I grew up, I called him mine\nHe would always laugh and say\nRemember when we used to play?\nBang bang, I shot you down\nBang bang, you hit the ground\nBang bang, that awful sound\nBang bang, I used to shoot you down\n\nNow he's gone, I don't know why\nAnd 'til this day, sometimes I cry\nHe didn't even say goodbye\nHe didn't take the time to lie\n\nBang bang, he shot me down\nBang bang, I hit the ground\nBang bang, that awful sound\nBang bang, my baby shot me down"}
